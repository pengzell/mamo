May 1, 2025, marks the official launch of the MaMo project, which will run until April 2030 with generous support by the European Research Council (ERC). We will initially recruit two Research Fellows (Postdocs), to start in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Further details about the project, its development, members, events, and outputs will be shared on this website as they become available.
