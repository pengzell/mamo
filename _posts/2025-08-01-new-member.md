We are delighted to welcome [Dr. Joshua Choper](https://joshuachoper.github.io/) to MaMo as a Research Fellow. Josh joins us from Bocconi University, where he was a postdoctoral research fellow. He holds a PhD in Sociology from the University of California, Berkeley, and a Master’s in Public Policy from the University of Chicago. 

Josh’s research explores the labor market processes that generate inequality over workers’ careers. In his work, he examines how differences in earnings growth, job mobility, and job displacement are shaped by firms, local labor markets, and institutions, and how these patterns contribute to broader inequalities by race, gender, and class. 

Josh will contribute to MaMo's mission of understanding how the workplace shapes intergenerational mobility and developing strategies to promote fair opportunity in the labor market. We’re excited to have him join the team and look forward to the insights his research will bring to the project.
