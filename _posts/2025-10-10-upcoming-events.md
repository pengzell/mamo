In two upcoming events, Per Engzell will present work related to the MaMo project. 

**1. EAS Prize for Best Article**

We are pleased to share that Per Engzell, with Carina Mood, has been awarded the 2024 European Academy of Sociology (EAS) Prize for Best Article for “Understanding Patterns and Trends in Income Mobility through Multiverse Analysis”, published in the [*American Sociological Review*](https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224231180607).

Per will present the paper at the EAS Annual Meeting in Paris, November 8, 2025, where he will discuss the study’s contributions to understanding income mobility, and how labor market processes are indispensible to explaining trends that occurred in the last half century.

**2. Workshop on Intergenerational Persistence and Inequality (EUI, Florence)**

Per will also take part in an upcoming workshop on “[Intergenerational Persistence and Inequality](https://www.eui.eu/events?id=580601)” at the European University Institute in Florence on November 10.

Organized by Alexander Ludwig, Herman van de Werfhorst, and Francis Vella, the event brings together leading scholars from sociology and economics to discuss how inequalities persist or change across generations. Sessions will cover new evidence on gender, geography, and networks in mobility, concluding with a policy panel featuring experts from the OECD, World Bank, and European Commission.
